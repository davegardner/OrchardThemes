    <h1>Booking workflow</h1>
    <p>
        There are two ways to make a booking:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Without paying.
            An unpaid booking simply sends an email to Victor with the order details.
            It is up to Victor to negotiate and secure payment.
        </li>
        <li>
            With payment.
            A paid booking also sends an email to Victor,
            but the email is marked paid and Victor knows that the client has booked and paid for the work.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Essentially, the same Order/Booking form is used but it has two buttons:
    </p>
    <div>
        <button>Pay Now</button> <button>Pay Later</button>
    </div>
    <h2>Workflow Without Payment</h2>
    <p>
        Submitting the form by clicking [Pay Later] invokes some workflow that provides a notification to the client,
        and sends emails to Victor and the client.
    </p>
    <h2>Workflow With Payment</h2>
    <p>
        If the client clicks [Pay Now] they walk thru the Checkout procedure.
        At the end of the checkout process emails are sent to Victor and the client, marked "paid".
        This is an all or nothing process where a successful booking and payment results in emails being sent,
        but if the client doesn't complete the payment then no email is sent to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        The email sent to the client is a Receipt and is NOT a tax invoice. It is up to Victor to confirm that payment is actually
        received and to issue an appropriate tax invoice.
    </p>
 
    <p>
        Also, put two buttons at the bottom:

    </p>
    <div>
        <button>Pay Now</button> <button>Pay Later</button>
    </div>
    <p>
        [Pay Now] proceeds to the Checkout/Summary page so the customer can pay.
    </p>
    <p>
        [Pay Later] displays a page with the message:
        <blockquote>
            "Your booking has been accepted and you have elected to pay later and will be billed accordingly.
            If you don't have an account with us then you will need to pay at the time service is provided".

            <div>
                <button>OK, I'll pay later</button> <button>Change (Pay now)</button>
            </div>
        </blockquote>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Changes Needed to Implement Order Bookings
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Create an OrderPart from the existing Order Record. Requires minor changes to the Cascade.WebShop module.</li>
        <li>
            Add the following Fields to OrderPart, using Orchard admin Content Definition:
            <ul>
                <li>Preferred Days Enumeration</li>
                <li>Preferred Times Enumeration</li>
                <li>Specific Date (overrides Preferred Days/Times)</li>
                <li>Notes Text</li>
                <li>
                    Service Address:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Address Text</li>
                        <li>Suburb Text</li>
                        <li>Postcode Text</li>
                        <li>Contact Phone Text</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Remove 'Delivery Address' from SelectAddress.cshtml. No need to change anything else. This will apply to both new and returning customers. Make change by by overriding template in the theme </li>
        <li>
            Change CheckoutSummary.cshtml by overriding templates in the theme
            <ul>
                <li>show 'Service Address' instead of shipping address</li>
                <li>add two buttons: <button>Pay Now</button> and <button>Pay Later</button></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Update text of buttons on ShoppingCart and Checkout pages to reflect workflow by overriding templates in the theme</li>
        <li>Change price calculation to allow for volume discounts (ie multiple services on one booking/order). This will require implementation of a new Discount OrderDetail in WebShop. Do last, if necessary</li>
    </ul>
